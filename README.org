* Summary

=arscript-mode= is an Emacs major mode designed to facilitate the editing of arscript files, providing syntax highlighting and other useful editing features tailored specifically for the arscript file format.

#+begin_quote
ArtRage arscript files are specialized script files used by the ArtRage painting software to automate and record various painting actions and effects. These files encapsulate sequences of drawing commands, tool selections, color settings, and other actions that can be replayed to recreate the painting process. The arscript format includes structured elements such as keywords, modifiers, structured tags, and numerical values, allowing for detailed specification of both high-level actions and granular details like brush strokes and layer manipulations. The format aims to facilitate complex artistic workflows by enabling repeatable and shareable painting routines, making it an essential tool for digital artists using ArtRage.

* Whats New

** v0.1.0

First version

* Features

- Syntax highlighting for arscript-specific keywords, modifiers, and structures.
- Custom indentation logic for arscript code blocks.
- Auto-detection of .arscript files to automatically enable the mode.

* Installation

** use-package (MELPA)

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package arscript-mode)
#+end_src

** use-package (emacs 30+) directly from github

Put the following into your emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package arscript-mode
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/arscript-mode"))
#+end_src

** From source

Download the `.el` file and place it in your Emacs `load-path` or in a specific source directory "~/source/repos/arscript-mode"

Then either manually load it or add it to your configuration to be loaded at startup.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'arscript-mode)
#+end_src

OR

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package arscript-mode
  :load-path "~/source/repos/arscript-mode")
#+end_src

* Usage

Opening any .arscript file with Emacs should automatically enable =arscript-mode=, providing you with syntax highlighting and indentation support for editing arscript files.

If you are not an ArtRage user and are just curious about this specialized ArtRage painting playback script then there is an example attached to demonstrate the functionality of this mode :

* Customization

Currently, =arscript-mode= provides a basic set of features optimized for general usage. Future versions may include customizable options based on user feedback.

* Testing

See CHANGELOG.org

* Alternatives

As far as I can tell this is the first Emacs major mode supporting the arscript format.
